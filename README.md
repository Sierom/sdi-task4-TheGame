It's a dart game. You have to HOLD the button of the two thingies to start. The red thingy control the red gauge (red gauge controls the heigt of the throw), and the green one the green gauge (green gauge controls if the shot goes to the left/right). When you release a button, the cursor in the gauge stop moving and when the 2 buttons are released, the dart in throw.
